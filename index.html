                <p class="h4 text-justify text-muted font-weight-light">I was born on 09.28.1979 in the capital of Armenia, Yerevan. As a child, I loved scolding all day.
                    <br>In 1985 I entered primary school, where I studied for 11 years. All this time and after that, too, I adored math. After studying, I served in the Armenian army as a senior sergeant. Then I started working. In the initial time,
                    I worked as a waiter at the bar. After that, I started to work as a coordinator in a public organization for the protection of the rights of car drivers. Next, I began to learn 3D modeling of jewelry and worked in this specialty for
                    almost a year. In the end, I received an offer from one of the biggest automotive industry (Toyota) and accepted it with great satisfaction, since I loved this industry. I worked there for 10 years. I speak three languages. In 2005,
                    I got married to the best girl in the world. We have two children, a son, and a daughter. <br>In 2017 my family and I moved to the USA.</p>
